# Taskly
Taskly is a simple yet effective to-do application developed as part of my journey into learning Flutter. This app allows you to efficiently manage your tasks with features for adding, completing, and deleting tasks. Additionally, you can set a due date for each task and assign a priority level to indicate its importance.

## Features

- **Add Tasks:** Create new tasks with a description, due date, and priority level.
- **Complete Tasks:** Mark tasks as completed, which will move them to the completed tasks screen.
- **Delete and Restore Tasks:** Remove completed tasks or restore them if needed.
- **Authentication:** Sign up and log in using your email or phone number via Firebase Authentication.
